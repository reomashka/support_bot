## ‚ú® Features

When a user sends a message to the support chat it will create a ticket which will be forwarded to the staff group. Any admin in the staff group may answer that ticket by just replying to it. Salutation is added automatically. Photos will be forwarded too.

- [x] File forwarding from and to user
- [x] Database for handling open and closed tickets
- [x] Restrict users
- [x] Simple anti spam system
- [x] Send tickets to different staff groups
- [x] Private reply to user
- [x] Anonymize users

- [x] **Staff groups can now be on Telegram _or_ Signal**
- [x] **LLM support (OpenAI, OpenAI-compatible APIs)** ‚Äì generate automatic responses using large language models

## ü§ñ OpenAi Integration

The bot can now optionally connect to an LLM like OpenAI (or any OpenAI-compatible API) to automatically respond to users, especially for common questions or when no staff is available.

You can enable this by configuring the following in your `config.yaml`:

```yaml
use_llm: true # Will enable show_auto_replied when set to true
llm_api_key: 'API_KEY'
llm_base_url: 'https://api.openai.com/v1'
llm_model: 'gpt-4o-mini'
llm_knowledge: >

## üìù Upgrading from older versions

There are some breaking changes in the new versions. Please read the following instructions carefully when updating.

<details>
<summary>click here to show</summary>

Since version v4 this bot uses the grammY Telegram Bot Framework instead of the telegraf framework for various reasons.

### Upgrading to v4.0.0

Make sure you add the new settings strings to your config.yaml file. Check the config-sample.yaml for all configs.
Here are some of the new settings that you should add when migrating:

    parse_mode: 'Markdown' # DO NOT CHANGE!
    autoreply: (see config-sample.yaml for an example)

The config-sample.yaml settings now all use markdown instead of HTML so you have to adjust that. e.g. instead of <br/> line break use \n instead. For a full list check the telegram bot API docs.

Upgrade to the new version. e.g. by pulling the main branch from GitHub or using the docker image bostrot/telegram-support-bot:4.0.0.

Start it.

The old database should work with the new version without changing anything.

### Upgrading to v3.0.0

The latest version uses a new config file in YAML format which would break old versions.

In order to make old versions work with the master you would need to use the new config.yaml file instead of the config.ts file from before. The easiest would be if you copy the config-sample.yaml to config.yaml (both in the config folder) and edit the settings similar to your old config.ts file. There is no need to delete the database file so old tickets can be kept open.
